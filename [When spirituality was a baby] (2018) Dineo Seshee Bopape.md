 [When spirituality was a baby] (2018) Dineo Seshee Bopape | 2018 Collective, Edinburgh, UK   | 29/01/2019   |  Sculpture, installation, raw materials, projections, sound | [When spirituality was a baby] (2018) is an installation at Collective, which is in relation to the rich history of timekeeping, spirituality, geology and astronomy at the exhibition space – the Observatory site atop Edinburgh’s Calton Hill. This installation combines an array of raw materials – some of the materials are pick from the exhibition place, and others are from all over the world. The marks on the ground and the holes on the wall made by the artist have really altered this historic site and made it somehow a union of different space. And time has shaped all elements of the installation, during a period of nine months. | Site-specific, Installation, Space, Analogue, Time
