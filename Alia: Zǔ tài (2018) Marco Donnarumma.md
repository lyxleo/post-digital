 Alia: Zǔ tài (2018) Marco Donnarumma | 2018    | 25/02/2019   |  AI prosthetic robots, adaptive neural networks, biosensors, LED light, computer-processed sound, multi-channel diffusion, black paint | Alia: Zǔ tài is a ritual of acceptance for three mongrel bodies. Through a reckless play of power and vulnerability, a group of humans and artificially intelligent prostheses build and destroy their relationships. Alia: Zǔ tài combines dance theater and biophysical music with state-of-the-art AI robotics. Three humans and two AI robots inhabit an aseptic space, whose uncanny whiteness is interrupted by neatly ordered computer screens, cables and circuit boards. Alia: Zǔ tài unleashes the violence and celebrates the frailty of both the human being and AI technology. It’s a portray of hybrid identities and mongrel relationships, where both utopia and dystopias are shattered by the psychological power and dangers of technology. And Alia: Zǔ tài is part of the 7 Configurations cycle (2014-2019), in which the artist working in collaboration, probes the physical, psychological and cultural conflicts surrounding the human body in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). https://marcodonnarumma.com/works/alia-zu-tai/ | Hybrid, Tech-heavy, Biological, Robotic, Performance, Collaborative
