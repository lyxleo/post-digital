 WeltenLinie (2017) Alicja Kwade | 2018 Hayward Gallery, London, UK   | 19/11/2018   |  Installation, steel, mirror, wood, stone, performance | In WeltenLinie (2017) – which in Space Shifters takes over almost the entirety of one of Hayward’s lower galleries – nothing is quite what it seems. Using double-sided mirrors and carefully placed, paired objects, the artist achieves the illusion of sudden and surprising material transformations. As we move around and through Kwade’s steel-framed structure, the way we read and understand the objects within it shifts dramatically, depending on our perspective. Speaking of WeltenLinie, the artist has said ‘I hope that it is more like a feeling or an experience than a solid sculpture’, more like a ‘phantasm rather than an object’. | Site-specific, Installation, Interactive, Space, Analogue
