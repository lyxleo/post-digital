 Tremble Tremble (2018) Jesse Jones | 2018 Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh, UK   | 18/12/2018   |  Video, sculpture, sound, smoke, image projection, performance | Tremble Tremble (2018) is a 30-minute performance of what the artist Jesse Jones describes as “expanded cinema”, exhibited at the Talbot Rice Gallery in Edinburgh, UK. The whole performance offers immersive and almost psychedelic experience for the audience. Large-scale curtains with mysterious images projected on it are pulled through in the room by performers, a circle is carved again and again into the wall by performers, and smoke emerges from the crack in the floorboards. | Site-specific, Installation, Performance, Interactive, Space, Digital, Collaborative
