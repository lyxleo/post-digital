 20:50 (1987) Richard Wilson | 2018 Hayward Gallery, London, UK   | 19/11/2018   |  Sculpture, installation, engine oil | In the installation 20:50 (1987), the artist filled a room of the Hayward Gallery with engine oil, leaving only a narrow path into the center. The dark, dense surface reflects the space and creates a dizzy “infinity” for the viewers. “We all have preconceptions about architectural space, about rooms, about buildings – whether they’re galleries or museums or not, and if you can do something that unsettles those preconceptions, you can generate a whole new way of understanding your place in the world”, said the artist. | Site-specific, Installation, Interactive, Space, Analogue
