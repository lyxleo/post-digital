 Shibboleth I (2007) Doris Salcedo | 2007 outside Tate Modern, London, UK   | 22/02/2019   |  Digital print on paper | Shibboleth I (2007) is a medium-size digital photograph by the Colombian artist Doris Salcedo that depicts the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern, London, with a long narrow crack running along its floor. The print is part of a portfolio of four photographs each showing different views of the same scene. The photographs were made as part of Salcedo’s 2007 installation project for the Unilever Series at Tate Modern, also titled Shibboleth, which involved the artist creating a deep fissure in the floor of the Turbine Hall and thus transformed the space.
The term ‘shibboleth’ refers to a word, phrase or custom that can be used to test whether or not an individual belongs to a particular group or region. The crack in the floor in the Shibboleth photographs and installation could be seen as a symbol of the damage caused by cultural and geographical exclusion. Shibboleth reflects Salcedo’s belief that modern art museums themselves enact this form of exclusion as histories of twentieth-century modernism have until recently largely failed to address the contributions made by non-European cultures. https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/salcedo-shibboleth-i-p20334 | Site-specific, Space, Analogue, Interactive
