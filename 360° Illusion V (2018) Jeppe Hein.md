 360° Illusion V (2018) Jeppe Hein | 2018 Hayward Gallery, London, UK   | 19/11/2018   |  Sculpture, installation, mirror | The kinetic sculpture 360° Illusion V (2018) – situated in the first room of the exhibition – consists of two large mirrored panels that have been placed at right-angles to one another. As well as reflecting the surrounding environment, each mirror also reflects its twin. As the artwork rotates, we see ourselves and other visitors suspended within its curious double reflection, a visual effect that prompts Hein to ask, ‘Are you outside or inside the work? You don’t really know’. | Site-specific, Installation, Interactive, Space, Analogue
